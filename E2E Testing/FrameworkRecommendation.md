Both TestCafe and CodeceptJS are excellent frameworks for end-to-end testing. However, for beignners to end-to-end testing, 
I would recommend CodeceptJS. It is a more beginner-friendly framework with a simpler syntax. 
Additionally, CodeceptJS has a large community and a lot of documentation available online.

It supports a variety of testing frameworks, including Mocha, Jasmine, and Cucumber.
It can be used to test web applications, mobile applications, and APIs.
