I recommend using Karate for functional testing because it is a simple and expressive language that is easy to learn and use.
Karate also has a number of features that make it well-suited for functional testing, such as:

Support for multiple protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, and JMS
Support for data-driven testing
Support for parallel testing
A built-in reporting system
Overall, Karate is a powerful and versatile tool for functional testing.
